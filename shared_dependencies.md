1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the other CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css"). It will contain the id names of the DOM elements that may be used by potential JavaScript functions.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id selectors that match those in the "index.html" file.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It will be linked in the "index.html" file and will provide styles that can be used throughout the website.

1. HTML Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the "index.html" file. They can be used in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files to apply specific styles to these elements.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers that can be used on multiple elements in the "index.html" file. They can be defined in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files to apply specific styles to these elements.

3. CSS Selectors: These are used in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files to select and style HTML elements based on their id, class, type, etc.

4. Link to CSS Files: The "index.html" file will have links to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files, allowing it to use the styles defined in these files.

5. Tailwind Utility Classes: These are classes provided by the Tailwind CSS framework that can be used in the "index.html" file to apply styles. They are defined in the "tailwind.css" file.
